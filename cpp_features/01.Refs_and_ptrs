References & pointers both refer to some other target object
Key differences

- a pointer; a separate variable
- a reference; an alias to its target

* obtaining values

-- when a pointer's value is obtained, we get the address of its target 
   To find the value of the target of 'ptr', dereference is needed as '*ptr'

-- when a reference's value is obtained, the dereferencing is executed 
   automatically by the compiler and target's value can be accessed immediately
   To get the address of 'ref', the address-of operator is needed '&ref' 


* Assignment

-- A pointer can be designated an address of a different target and also can be 
   assigned to nullptr to make the pointer not to point any object.
   Since a pointer is a variable, it has an address of its own, which can be 
   assiged to another variable
   int var = 10;
   int *ptr = &var;
   *ptr = 20;
   int **ptr = &ptr;
   **ptr = 30;

 -- A reference can only be initialized, but not assigned because assignment to 
    a reference means assignment to the original object it refers to
