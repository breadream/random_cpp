Three commonly used pointer types 
- A smart pointer is a class which encapsulates an actual pointer to a dynamically 
  allocated object, keeps track of its usage, and ensures that memory is deallocated 
  when it is appropriate so that there's no memory/resource leak.
	-- unique_ptr: destroys the object when the variable goes out of scope. 
		           Ownership can be transferred to another unique_ptr
