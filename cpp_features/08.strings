How C-style strings and C++ strings are different?

- C string; not a type of its own.
			an array of chars that ends with '\0' (null terminated)
- C++ string; an object from the string class


- library methods for C string don't have any concept of memory safety
-> could cause out-of-bound access errors, memory corruption

- C++ string methods have a much richer set of operators
