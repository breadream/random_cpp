If you initiate a class with no methods and that doesn't inherit from another class,
the compiler will add 4 methods to it spontaneously. These are 
	- Default constructor; an empty default constructor
	- Destructor; an empty destructor, calls the superclass destructor and 
				  the destructor for member fields (not of primitive type)
	- Copy constructor: a copy constructor that initializes every instance member 
				        with a corresponding member of the constructor's argument
	- Copy assignment operator:
