malloc() / free()  vs  new / delete 

* Similarity; allocate space on the heap

- malloc(); type-agnostic, allocates uninitialized memory blocks of required size
			returns a void pointer (a generic pointer that can be pointed at any data type)


- new; allocates a memory block required to hold an object of specific type 
		returns a 'type-safe' pointer
- delete; freeing the memory / ensures the object's destructor is called
