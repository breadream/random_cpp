malloc() / free()  vs  new / delete 
* Similarity; allocate space on the heap
- malloc(); type-agnostic, allocates uninitialized memory blocks of required size
			returns a void pointer (a generic pointer that can be pointed at any data type)
- new; allocates a memory block required to hold an object of specific type 
		returns a type-safe pointer
- delete; freeing the memory / ensures the object's destructor is called
