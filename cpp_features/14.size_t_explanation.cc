// size_t is an unsigned integer type that is the result of the "sizeof" operator
// we can be certain that it is big enough to contain the size of 
// the biggest object out system can handle 

// size_t is never negative. Since it is unsigned,
// we can store numbers that are roughly twice as big as in the 
// corresponding signed type
